When the chromosomes are named after manual curation they are named in length order not in the order you have put them in after manual curation. This obscures relationships so we renamed the chromosomes so they reflected the order that they had been manually curated in.

Udecum_v1.1.0.fasta.inter.csv

The inter file had the oG names RL_ and then a list of numbers next to them which were what they were renamed to. We used that file as a basis to create another file to use to edit chromosome names
