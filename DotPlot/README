README

To compare the haplotype aware chromosome level tetraploid decumbens genome with the collapsed diploid ruziziensis Genome_report, the genomes were subsetted to just chromosomes and then the chromosome names edited to make them more readable in the graph.
The two fastas were uploaded to DGenies https://dgenies.toulouse.inra.fr/ with ruziziensis being the target.
